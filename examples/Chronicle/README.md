# Chronicle

The Chronicle UI kit, built on ColumbaEngine. Everything here lives in the
`chronicle` namespace; engine types are used as `pg::…`.

## Running

Run from the repo root (assets are read relative to the working directory):

```
./build/Chronicle --dev TypeSpecimen          # the type/colour specimen dev scene
./build/Chronicle --dev TypeSpecimen --theme candle
```

`--dev <Scene>` picks a dev scene; an unknown name exits with code 2 before a
window opens. With no `--dev`, `TypeSpecimen` is the current default (the Life
scene replaces it in phase 2).

Tests:

```
cmake --build . --target test_chronicle
ctest -R "tokens|textstyle" --output-on-failure
```

## Layout

- `Core/` — data with no rendering: `tokens` (colours/spacing/borders/opacities,
  two themes, alias resolution), `textstyle` (one font atlas per style at exact
  pixel size), `fontfiles` (the family × weight × italic → ttf table).
- `Scenes/` — dev scenes. `TypeSpecimen` shows every style on vellum.
- `UI/` — components (added from phase 1.2 onward).

## Rules

- **`chronicle` namespace.** Everything under `examples/Chronicle/` is in
  `chronicle`; engine types are `pg::…`.
- **Promote only generic constructs.** Anything that is not Chronicle-specific
  (a shader, an engine component, a system) belongs in the engine, not here.
  Chronicle mentions no engine internals it did not put there.
- **Figures** are set only in `figure-xl`, `figure` and `tick`. EB Garamond's
  default digits are lining and tabular; Cormorant's are proportional, so a
  number in a display style will reflow its row.

## Components

- **Label** (`UI/label.h`) — a style, a colour token, an alignment, and one of
  three overflows: `Grow` (box = measured width), `Wrap` (box = given width,
  text wraps, `maxLines` truncates with an ellipsis), `Ellipsis` (one line,
  shortened with `…`). Box height is always the token line height. Wrapped text
  is always left-set: the engine has no per-line alignment, so a wrapped
  `Centre`/`Right` label is set as `Left` (warned once).

- **Mark** (`UI/mark.h`) — one of 27 glyphs at one of five kit sizes
  (14/16/18/24/48 px), registered at exactly those sizes so nothing resamples.
  `markSizeFor(style)` is the single style → size table (body → 16, figure → 18,
  title → 24, versal → 48, the small styles → 14). An unknown name draws `seal`
  and logs once — a missing mark is visible, never blank. A mark always takes
  the colour of the text beside it.
- **MarkedLabel** (`UI/mark.h`) — a `Mark`, a `space-2` gap, and a `Label` under
  one root: the pair nearly every row is. The colour lives on the label and the
  mark takes it (structural — there is no mark-colour field). `reserveMark`
  keeps the mark column when the mark is empty so a list still aligns its text.
  A `versal` label is the one case where the mark (48 px) drives the row height.

- **Ornament** (`UI/mark.h`'s sibling `UI/ornament.h`) — the scribe's ruling and the
  illuminator's frames, in four kinds: a **Divider** (1 px `rule-hair` or 2 px
  `rule-ruled`, with an optional knot whose opaque *ground* patch masks the rule
  underneath — pass the token of the surface the divider sits on as `ground`), a
  **Flourish** band, a gold **Corner**, and a 72×72 **Versal** (an inset G4 stroke
  frame, drawn curls, and a `chapter`-set initial nudged so its *cap* — not its
  line box — centres in the frame, using `kCormorantCapRatio = 0.63`). The versal
  letter is set in `chapter` (44 px Cormorant SemiBold), the nearest registered
  atlas to the design system's 46 px versal.

- **Panel** (`UI/panel.h`) — a leaf of folio with a drawn frame, an optional
  head row (mark · title · small-caps aside on one baseline) over a knotless
  hair rule, and a `VerticalLayout` body that grows with its rows (the root's
  height is a `PosConstrain` on the body). Four frames: `Hair` (quiet), `Ruled`
  (the default), `Plain` (no ground/frame/padding), `Illuminated` (doubled gold
  frame + four inset corners, `space-5` padding — the five gold events only).
  The panel never sets a child's z: the caller builds children at
  `z ≥ spec.contentZ`, which must clear the head band (`> z + 4`). A nested panel
  is a child like any other, at `contentZ` and `contentZ + 10`. There is no
  `setFrame` (an illuminated panel is a different object, not a state) and no
  shadow (separation comes from the rule).

## Gate: phase 1

- **Pending** (2026-09-20): `--dev PanelGallery` reproduces the design system's
  three panels for side-by-side comparison at 100 %. Outcome (rule weight,
  padding, heading, divider, body, corners, Candle) to be recorded here after the
  comparison; any 1–5 miss is fixed in 1.1–1.4 before 1.6.

## Assets

- The **mark** set (`res/icons/chronicle/`, 27 glyphs) and the **ornament** set
  (`res/icons/chronicle-ornaments/`, 7 curves) are SVGs authored on **square**
  viewBoxes: `SvgLoader::rasterize` fits a document into a square and centres it,
  so a square viewBox makes the quad and the drawing coincide with no offset. The
  four corners ship pre-mirrored (`corner-tl/tr/bl/br`) because the icon system
  has no flip.

## Adding a dev scene

One line in `Scenes/devscenes.cpp`: add `{"MyScene", [](auto* s, auto* t, auto* st){ s->loadSystemScene<MyScene>(t, st); }}`
to `devScenes()`. `--dev` and its error listing pick it up automatically.
