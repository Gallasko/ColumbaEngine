# Chronicle

The Chronicle UI kit, built on ColumbaEngine. Everything here lives in the
`chronicle` namespace; engine types are used as `pg::…`.

## Running

Run from the repo root (assets are read relative to the working directory):

```
./build/Chronicle --dev TypeSpecimen          # the type/colour specimen dev scene
./build/Chronicle --dev TypeSpecimen --theme candle
```

`--dev <Scene>` picks a dev scene; an unknown name exits with code 2 before a
window opens. With no `--dev`, `TypeSpecimen` is the current default (the Life
scene replaces it in phase 2).

Tests:

```
cmake --build . --target test_chronicle
ctest -R "tokens|textstyle" --output-on-failure
```

## Layout

- `Core/` — data with no rendering: `tokens` (colours/spacing/borders/opacities,
  two themes, alias resolution), `textstyle` (one font atlas per style at exact
  pixel size), `fontfiles` (the family × weight × italic → ttf table).
- `Scenes/` — dev scenes. `TypeSpecimen` shows every style on vellum.
- `UI/` — components (added from phase 1.2 onward).

## Rules

- **`chronicle` namespace.** Everything under `examples/Chronicle/` is in
  `chronicle`; engine types are `pg::…`.
- **Promote only generic constructs.** Anything that is not Chronicle-specific
  (a shader, an engine component, a system) belongs in the engine, not here.
  Chronicle mentions no engine internals it did not put there.
- **Figures** are set only in `figure-xl`, `figure` and `tick`. EB Garamond's
  default digits are lining and tabular; Cormorant's are proportional, so a
  number in a display style will reflow its row.

## Components

**Phase 2 rule: components are fed.** From `ProgressRule` on, a component exposes
*setters only* (`setPercent`, `setValue`, `setState`, …) and computes nothing from
months, stats or rules — no game logic, no reading of game state. The Life scene
subscribes to `GameDataView` paths and calls the setters; a dev scene calls the
same setters with fixed values. The same prefab is driven by both; the numbers
come from `rules/*.pg` through the scene, never from the component.

- **Label** (`UI/label.h`) — a style, a colour token, an alignment, and one of
  three overflows: `Grow` (box = measured width), `Wrap` (box = given width,
  text wraps, `maxLines` truncates with an ellipsis), `Ellipsis` (one line,
  shortened with `…`). Box height is always the token line height. A label is
  one entity: overflow, alignment (per line, wrapped included) and elision all
  live on the engine's `TTFText`; the label adds the style and the colour
  token.

- **Mark** (`UI/mark.h`) — one of 27 glyphs at one of five kit sizes
  (14/16/18/24/48 px), registered at exactly those sizes so nothing resamples.
  `markSizeFor(style)` is the single style → size table (body → 16, figure → 18,
  title → 24, versal → 48, the small styles → 14). An unknown name draws `seal`
  and logs once — a missing mark is visible, never blank. A mark always takes
  the colour of the text beside it.
- **MarkedLabel** (`UI/mark.h`) — a `Mark`, a `space-2` gap, and a `Label` under
  one root: the pair nearly every row is. The colour lives on the label and the
  mark takes it (structural — there is no mark-colour field). `reserveMark`
  keeps the mark column when the mark is empty so a list still aligns its text.
  A `versal` label is the one case where the mark (48 px) drives the row height.

- **Ornament** (`UI/mark.h`'s sibling `UI/ornament.h`) — the scribe's ruling and the
  illuminator's frames, in four kinds: a **Divider** (1 px `rule-hair` or 2 px
  `rule-ruled`, with an optional knot whose opaque *ground* patch masks the rule
  underneath — pass the token of the surface the divider sits on as `ground`), a
  **Flourish** band, a gold **Corner**, and a 72×72 **Versal** (an inset G4 stroke
  frame, drawn curls, and a `chapter`-set initial nudged so its *cap* — not its
  line box — centres in the frame, using `kCormorantCapRatio = 0.63`). The versal
  letter is set in `chapter` (44 px Cormorant SemiBold), the nearest registered
  atlas to the design system's 46 px versal.

- **Panel** (`UI/panel.h`) — a leaf of folio with a drawn frame, an optional
  head row (mark · title · small-caps aside on one baseline) over a knotless
  hair rule, and a `VerticalLayout` body that grows with its rows (the root's
  height is a `PosConstrain` on the body). Four frames: `Hair` (quiet), `Ruled`
  (the default), `Plain` (no ground/frame/padding), `Illuminated` (doubled gold
  frame + four inset corners, `space-5` padding — the five gold events only).
  The panel never sets a child's z: the caller builds children at
  `z ≥ spec.contentZ`, which must clear the head band (`> z + 4`). A nested panel
  is a child like any other, at `contentZ` and `contentZ + 10`. There is no
  `setFrame` (an illuminated panel is a different object, not a state) and no
  shadow (separation comes from the rule).

- **Button** (`UI/button.h`) — the game's "do it" control: a face (mark · control
  label · optional "N mo" cost) on a rounded folio/`lapis`/`vermilion` ground with
  a 1px frame. Three variants: `Quiet` (default), `Study` (lapis), `Seal`
  (vermilion, irreversible — one per screen). Activation is **release inside a
  pressed face**, or Enter/Space on the keyboard-focused face — both send
  `ButtonActivatedEvent{face, tag}`. Hover tints the Quiet fill / sheens the tonal
  ones; **Tab** walks the faces drawing a 2px `focus-ink` ring 2px outside; a mouse
  click hides every ring. A disabled button dims to `opacity-locked`, swallows
  input, and **states the gap in figures** in a `caption` reason beneath it (the
  reason itself is not dimmed). There is no pressed visual and no `setFrame`.

- **Gloss** (`UI/gloss.h`) — the scribe's voice, in two forms. A **Margin** gloss
  is a 2px `rule-hair` left edge with italic `gloss` text (≤ 240px, flavour only).
  A **Tooltip** gloss is a folio leaf with a `rule-ruled` frame holding a title,
  text, rows of right-aligned tabular figures, and a caps footnote — where a row's
  real numbers live. The tooltip form is registered under a **key** on
  `GlossRegistry` and shown through the engine's `TooltipSystem`
  (`attachGloss(entity, key)`), so delay, placement, flipping and click-to-hide are
  inherited; a missing key shows a `vermilion` fallback, like a missing mark.

- **Tabs** (`UI/tabs.h`) — the book's chapters as *lettering*, not buttons: labels
  on one `rule-ruled` hairline, the open chapter marked by a 3px `vermilion`
  underline that overlaps the rule by exactly 1px, an optional count badge per tab.
  Selection is release-inside or Enter/Space; **←/→** move the selection within the
  row (no wrap). Only `TabSelectedEvent` is reported — a `Tabs` row never decides
  what a chapter shows.

- **ProgressRule** (`UI/progressrule.h`) — the quill writing across a groove: a
  `progress-track`, a `progress-ink` fill, a 45° `progress-forecast` hatch of what
  the running activity will reach (starting at the fill's head), the `quill` nib
  riding that head, and a caption of figures. Setters only (the phase-2 rule):
  `setPercent(p, animate)` tweens the fill linearly at `Motion::kMsPerPercent`
  (6 ms/point; jumps under `Motion::reduced()`), `setForecast` never animates (a
  forecast is a statement), `setCaption`/`setNib`/`setWidth` re-lay. The fill's
  left corners are rounded 2px in the design system — not distinguishable under a
  1px frame at 8px height, so noted not implemented. The tween lives on the fill
  entity and captures the `ProgressRule` by pointer, so keep it at a stable address
  while it animates.

- **StatLine** (`UI/statline.h`) — one part of the character: *the figure is the
  point, the bar is the glance*. A name (mark S16 + `label` style, both `ink-muted`)
  at the left and the figure (`figure`, `ink`) at the right on one baseline, with the
  running activity's projection beside it (`-> 17`, in `tick`/`progress-forecast`);
  then a groove — a `ProgressRule` with the nib off and an 8px track, so the hatch,
  the fill animation and the reduced-motion rule are inherited, not repeated — solid
  fill for the present value, hatched ghost for the projected gain; a 2px
  `status-time` tick standing *on* the track (z+6, above the groove's frame) where the
  next milestone's requirement sits; and a `caption`/`ink-faint` note beneath naming
  it. Fed, not driven: `setValue(v, animate)` sets the figure at once and tweens the
  fill after it (the figure is the fact, the bar catches up) — and clears the
  projection if the value rises past it; `setProjected(p)` shows `-> p` only when
  `p > value` (a projection at or below the value is not a projection) and moves the
  figure's right anchor to the projection's left, so the figure never reflows;
  `setThreshold(t)` re-places the tick or hides it (the entity is kept — a threshold
  comes and goes as milestones pass); `setNote(s)` grows the root to follow. The
  display label is upper-cased **ASCII only** (`label` is the caps style; the four MVP
  parts — Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, Vitality — are ASCII). `glossKey` points the
  whole line at a registered gloss.

- **RequirementList** (`UI/requirementlist.h`) — prerequisites as a checked list:
  each row carries a **mark as well as a colour** (`check` in `status-gain` when met,
  `cross` in `status-loss` when not) and shows the pair "current / needed", never a
  verdict. *The mark carries the state, the label carries the words*: the mark and
  the value take the tone, the label stays `ink` when unmet and recedes to
  `ink-muted` when met — the one row in the kit where mark and label differ in
  colour by design. `met` is the scene's to say: an explicit 0/1 **wins over** the
  derived `current >= needed` (a display rule, not a game rule); non-numeric
  conditions (*"Has the Guild's letter"*) pass `met` directly and show no pair (one
  with no verdict logs once and shows unmet). Two densities: roomy (`body-sm` +
  `figure-sm`) and **dense = `tick`** for both label and value — the mark stays S14
  in both. Values right-align so the slashes stack; the label's ellipsis width
  leaves room for the pair. Fed: `setItems` rebuilds, `setItem(i, c, n)` updates a
  pair in place (re-deriving `met` unless explicit), `setMet`/`clearMet` repaint
  tokens only — nothing moves.

## Patterns

- **State component + System + event-driven tests.** A stateful, input-receiving
  component (Button, and the tabs and every phase-2 row after it) puts a
  `chronicle::…State` `pg::Component` on the hit entity, a matching `…System` that
  `Listener`s the engine's input events (`HoverChangedEvent`, `OnMouseClick`,
  `OnFocus`, …) and repaints via an `applyVisual`, and tests that drive those
  events (`OnMouseMove`/`OnMouseClick`/`OnSDLScanCode`) exactly as `test/hover.cc`
  does — `pump()` = 3×`executeOnce` after each.

- **One Tab order for the kit (`FocusOrderSystem`).** Keyboard focus traversal is
  not each component's job: `FocusOrderSystem` owns one order for every focusable
  face (buttons, tabs, later rows), walks it on Tab/Shift-Tab (skipping disabled),
  and announces every change with `KeyboardFocusChangedEvent`. A component's system
  only draws its ring from that event and calls `add`/`setEnabled`/`focus(id)`.

## Phase 1 complete

**2026-09-21** — Phase 1 lands the kit's seven components and seven dev scenes,
all tested (133 `test_chronicle` + engine `t1` green):

- **Components**: `Label`, `Mark`, `Ornament`, `Panel`, `Button`, `Gloss`, `Tabs`
  (plus the `Tokens`/`TextStyles` core and the `PaintSystem`/`FocusOrderSystem`
  services).
- **Scenes**: `TypeSpecimen`, `LabelGallery`, `MarkGallery`, `OrnamentGallery`,
  `PanelGallery`, `ButtonGallery`, `TabsGlossGallery`.
- **Patterns**: the state-component + system + event-driven-tests shape, and one
  Tab order for the whole kit. Phase 2 (`ProgressRule` first) builds on these.

## Gate: phase 1

- **Passed** (2026-09-20): `--dev PanelGallery` compared against the design
  system's Panel preview. Rule weight, padding, heading (mark · title · aside on
  one baseline), the knotless divider, the wrapping body, and the illuminated
  corners all read the same; the frame/rules/ink/gold switch cleanly in Candle
  with nothing moving. No 1.1–1.4 fix was needed. Phase 1 is closed.

## Assets

- The **mark** set (`res/icons/chronicle/`, 27 glyphs) and the **ornament** set
  (`res/icons/chronicle-ornaments/`, 7 curves) are SVGs authored on **square**
  viewBoxes: `SvgLoader::rasterize` fits a document into a square and centres it,
  so a square viewBox makes the quad and the drawing coincide with no offset. The
  four corners ship pre-mirrored (`corner-tl/tr/bl/br`) because the icon system
  has no flip.

## Adding a dev scene

One line in `Scenes/devscenes.cpp`: add `{"MyScene", [](auto* s, auto* t, auto* st){ s->loadSystemScene<MyScene>(t, st); }}`
to `devScenes()`. `--dev` and its error listing pick it up automatically.
